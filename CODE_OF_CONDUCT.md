# Code of Conduct

All open source projects managed by NetFoundry share a common [code of
conduct](https://netfoundry.github.io/policies/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html) which all contributors are expected to follow.
Please be sure you read, understand and adhere to the thoughts expressed therein.

Individuals acting in any way that is considered in violation of the Code of Conduct will receive corrective actions
appropriate for the violation. It is possible to act in ways which technically do not violate the Code of Conduct but
are clearly against the spirit of the project. These situations will also be considered on a case by case basis and if
necessary the Code of Conduct will be revised accordingly and approrpiate notifications will be made to the community
and to the violator.

## Violations

Contributors violating the Code of Conduct will receive public notification of the violation. Continued violations or
aggregious violations of the Code of Conduct will result in the contributor being removed from the contributors list as
well as further contributions being declined.
