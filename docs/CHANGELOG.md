## v2.0.0

This is a major release. Check [our upgrade guide](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/blob/master/UPGRADE-GUIDE.md) for an overview on some key differences between v1 and v2.

### General changes

- Major: Node.js 0.10.x and 0.12.x support is dropped
- Major: `require('node-fetch/lib/response')` etc. is now unsupported; use `require('node-fetch').Response` or ES6 module imports
- Enhance: start testing on Node.js v4.x, v6.x, v8.x LTS, as well as v9.x stable
- Enhance: use Rollup to produce a distributed bundle (less memory overhead and faster startup)
- Enhance: make `Object.prototype.toString()` on Headers, Requests, and Responses return correct class strings
- Other: rewrite in ES2015 using Babel
- Other: use Codecov for code coverage tracking
- Other: update package.json script for npm 5
- Other: `encoding` module is now optional (alpha.7)
- Other: expose browser.js through package.json, avoid bundling mishaps (alpha.9)
- Other: allow TypeScript to `import` node-fetch by exposing default (alpha.9)

### HTTP requests

- Fix: errors in a response are caught before the body is accessed
- Fix: support WHATWG URL objects, created by `whatwg-url` package or `require('url').URL` in Node.js 7+

### Response and Request classes

- Major: `response.text()` no longer attempts to detect encoding, instead always opting for UTF-8 (per spec); use `response.textConverted()` for the v1 behavior
- Major: make `response.json()` throw error instead of returning an empty object on 204 no-content response (per spec; reverts behavior changed in v1.6.2)
- Major: internal methods are no longer exposed
- Major: throw error when a `GET` or `HEAD` Request is constructed with a non-null body (per spec)
- Enhance: add `response.arrayBuffer()` (also applies to Requests)
- Enhance: add experimental `response.blob()` (also applies to Requests)
- Enhance: `URLSearchParams` is now accepted as a body
- Enhance: wrap `response.json()` json parsing error as `FetchError`
- Fix: fix Request and Response with `null` body

### Headers class

- Major: remove `headers.getAll()`; make `get()` return all headers delimited by commas (per spec)
- Enhance: make Headers iterable
- Enhance: make Headers constructor accept an array of tuples
- Enhance: make sure header names and values are valid in HTTP
